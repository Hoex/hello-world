# hello-world
First GitHub entry

Hello,

  My name is Lloyd, other wise known as Hoex. I am currently 22 years old and a Computer Science/IT major.
  I have experience with multiple programming languages and hardware knownledge of a computer.
  
  Being this is my first time (noob) on GitHub, I plan to contribute as much code as possible for future reference.
  To start I will be developing Minecraft Plugins, simple but useful/fun additions to Minecraft that I enjoy and hope others
  will too.
  I have never developed a Mod or Plugin before so I will be working at my own pace throughout the process.
  
  If you have any questions or concerns please feel free to message me via email or Twitter, @Git_Hoex
